# Onchain Builder Proof

> **Immortalize Your Weekly Achievements on the Blockchain**

Onchain Builder Proof is a decentralized application (dApp) that empowers builders, developers, and creators to mint their weekly achievements directly onchain through Talenty Protocol. Every milestone, every breakthrough, and every accomplishment becomes a permanent, verifiable record on the blockchain—creating an immutable proof of your journey as a builder.

The platform is powered by a **BuilderProof smart contract** deployed and verified on **Base chain** at address `0xD96Da91A4DC052C860F4cA452efF924bd88CC437`. This smart contract handles all onchain operations, ensuring your achievements are stored permanently on the blockchain with complete transparency and immutability.

Unlike traditional achievement systems that rely on centralized databases, this platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure your achievements are **permanently recorded**, **publicly verifiable**, and **truly owned by you**. Built with Next.js 16 and Reown AppKit, it provides a seamless Web3 experience for documenting your builder journey onchain.
